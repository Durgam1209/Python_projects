# CLI_Calculator
Its a Command Line Interface Calculator built using python.
Here I have developed a simple calculor involving operations like addition,subtraction,multiplication,division and modulo/remainder.
-I have created a function called calculator:
    the reason is that it can be reused later for any other programs if required.
-Inside the calculator function, there's calculation function which performs all the required calculation logic using if-else statement.
-Then I return the values and print it.
